## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

```

### 2. Google API Setup

You need to set up Google API credentials for Gmail and Calendar access:

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the Gmail API and Google Calendar API
4. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials:
   - Go to "Credentials" â†’ "Create Credentials" â†’ "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs"
   - Choose "Desktop application"
   - Download the credentials file
5. Rename the downloaded file to `credentials.json` and place it in the project root

### 3. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
# Google API credentials (optional if using credentials.json)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8000/auth/callback

# Model configuration
MODEL_NAME=ayushadarsh7/gemma3n_2b_empath_geeta
MAX_SEQ_LENGTH=512
MAX_NEW_TOKENS=128

# File paths
CREDENTIALS_FILE=credentials.json
TOKEN_FILE=token.json
EMAIL_MARKDOWN_DIR=emails

# Server configuration
HOST=localhost
PORT=8000
```

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

#### Interactive Mode
```bash
python cli.py --interactive
```

#### Single Query
```bash
python cli.py --query "What's my schedule for today?"

- `GET /health` - Health check
- `GET /capabilities` - List assistant capabilities
- `POST /query` - Process user query

#### Example API Usage

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/query" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"query": "What is my schedule for today?"}'
```

```

## Authentication Flow

1. **First Run**: The application will open a browser window for Google OAuth2 authentication
2. **Authorization**: Grant permissions for Gmail and Calendar access
3. **Token Storage**: Tokens are automatically saved to `token.json`
4. **Subsequent Runs**: Tokens are automatically refreshed as needed

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Credentials file not found"**
   - Make sure `credentials.json` is in the project root
   - Download it from Google Cloud Console

2. **"Authentication failed"**
   - Delete `token.json` and re-authenticate
   - Check that your Google API credentials are correct

3. **"Model loading failed"**
   - Ensure you have sufficient GPU memory
   - Check your internet connection for model download

4. **"API quota exceeded"**
   - Google APIs have rate limits
   - Wait a few minutes and try again

### GPU Requirements

This application uses the Gemma3n model which requires:
- CUDA-compatible GPU
- At least 16GB VRAM (recommended)
- PyTorch with CUDA support
